Pointers are fundamental in dealing with hardware, we use them to implement higher level of abstractions.

Strings and vectors in c++ are implemented using pointers.

Pointers, which are the addresses of variables, can be accessed in C++.

But what if we have a pointer and want to access the value stored in that address? That process is called dereferencing, and it is indicated by adding the operator * before the variable's name. This same operator should be used to declare a variable that is meant to store a pointer.

Sparkâ€™s latest release - version 2.2.1 - supports two machine learning libraries spark.ml and spark.mllib. Both libraries are part of Spark's Machine Learning Library known as MLlib.

The term "Spark ML" is sometimes used to refer to the Spark Machine Learning library, which is officially called "MLlib"


a) Feature Extraction

Numeric Features
**Scalers**

  Normalizer
  StandardScaler
  MinMaxScaler
  MaxAbsScale

**Indexers**

  StringIndexer
  IndexToString
  VectorIndexer
  
b) Text Processing

Tokenization
Tokenization splits strings into separate words. Spark has a Tokenizer class as well as RegexTokenizer, which allows for more control over the tokenization process.

CountVectorizer

Inter-document Frequency

c) Dimensionality Reduction

d) Supervised ML Algorithms

Classification Algorithms
    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosted Trees
    Support Vector Machines

**1. Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.**

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

**2. Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.**

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

***3. Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.***

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight

Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight

Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight

Over 30 but below 35 they are obese

Above 35 they are clinically obese.
